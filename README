git apply won't work if:
 - you are in a untracked sub sub folder
 - you try to apply a `diff --git` patch

How to reproduce:

./populate.sh
cd external_srcs/subfolder/
git apply ../../git_diff.patch
# It does not have any effect: no patch applied, no error, no message
git apply ../../patch_diff.patch
# \o/ it works
